## notes

- site: https://atcoder.jp/
- profile: https://atcoder.jp/users/nsubaru
- template entry points: `TemplateCode.java` / `TemplateCode17.java` sit at the repo root for quick starts
- problem folders under `ABC000~` et al. keep each contest isolated in its `src` directory
- `start-local-runner.bat` bundles a JDK 17 test harness so you can pipe sample input without extra setup
- `AtCoder_Scripts` holds helper scripts for submission automation and local task listing when you want a bit more tooling
